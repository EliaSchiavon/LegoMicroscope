# LegoMicroscope

Wellcome to the Lego Microscope Github page. The aim is to provide the instructions and resources of the Lego Miscorsope for everybody interested. Additionally, we hope that you get inspired to introduce extension or improvements. We are especially keen on translations of the explorer kit instructions for kids. But here are many other things that you might think you can improve. If so, feel free to create a forge, and to upload your changes.

## Quick Intro

In this repository you will find the following key information to built your own Lego Microscope: 
- The building instructions as [PDF][pdf]
- The parts lists both as [Excel Sheet][parts_excel] and (more important) as [Bricklink xml][parts_xml] list. You can use the Bricklink list to quickly get the bricks in case you have no lego at home. 
- The links to webpages that cell the occular lenses (Europe, US)
- The smartphone lense we use here. 
- The [Textfile][explorer_text] of the Explorer Kit, which will help you to learn about microscopy and optics while you build the microscope. Or even better, the [ZIP][explorer_zip] file of the explorer kit. 
- The [scientific paper][bioRxiv] we wrote about the Lego Micoscope

## The Instructions

We have two sets of Instructions. 
- First the full plan that you want to use when you simply guild the microscope. 
- Second, a plan that is seperated into A,B,C and D, which is used if you want to follow the Explorer Kit. In case you want to do this, we advertize to directly download the  [ZIP][explorer_zip] file containing all the info for the kit. 

We created the instructions using the free software LDraw, which allows to generate basically any Lego building instructions. You can download LDraw, follow the instructions to install, and then you can open the CAD file of the plan. Here you have the possibility to add features and improve the plan as you think is good. Please don't forget to share the great improvements by creating a forge.

## The Non-Lego Parts
Although we tried to implement as much as possible using LEgo parts, including the illumination, we had to use some third party lenses, as lego does not offer optics. In the current state you need 3 types of additional lenses. 
- Occular: We used two simple 10cm plasic lenses as occular, which we combined using simple transparent tape
- Low Magnification Objective: Here we used a simple glass lense with a diameter of xxmm and a focal length of yy mm. You are welcome to use any other lenses here. For the lense to be able to mount in the Objective as planned in the instruction be careful about the dimensions. 
- High magnification Objective: HEre we used the plastic lense of a iPhone 4 cmera module. At the time of writing you can get these modules for about 2-4â‚¬ via ebay. It's a bit of a shame, as we remove all the fancy electronics, but we only need the lense :-)

# The explorer Kit
To have a bit more fun with the instructions, we generted a little guided tour that helps you to explore the potential of the Lego microscope. It is a simple idea to learn about optics while you built it. Did you know the difference between a magnification glass and a microscope? You might be superised how simple a microscope is principle is!
As for the instructions, we would be happy if you generte any improvements or extension for the explorer kit. Just create a fork and submitt your changes. 
He have currently generated translations for the explorer kit in several languages:
- English
- German
- Dutch
- Spanisch
- French
